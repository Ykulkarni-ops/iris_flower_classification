# Iris Flower classification using JSON

- For Iris flower classification I have used google colab. I have uploaded the zip file to google drive and made some changes to the namings to make the files usable with ease. 
- Step 1:
    - The first step in this project was to retrive the JSON data through an rtf file. 
    - I have used library striprtf to convert the rtf file to plain text file and then converted the plain text file to JSON. 
    - Once the file is converted to JSON I have used "json" library in python to parse the JSON data. 
    - The sample of JSON data is given below:</br>
